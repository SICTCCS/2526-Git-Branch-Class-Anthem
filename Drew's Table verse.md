Branch it out, don’t break the tree,\

We’re all synced up in Git history.\

No 8K streams, don't kill the speed,\

The EVSC net’s got limited need.\

Merge or rebase? The classic debate,\

My head's in fast-forward, repo won’t update.\

"Network timeout," now I’m feeling the pain,\

Bro, just pause the stream — it’s not even game day!\


Im gitin these branches\

doing so many dances\

commitin to these repos\

you know ive got a big ego\

Got me feelin' kinda droopy,\

all this code makin me loopy,\ 

"Where is this", "What is that?",\

I have this s*** takin' me back!\


back and forth is all we do.\

Always worrying about when things are due.\
