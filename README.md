# 2526-Git-Branch-Class-Anthem

**[Intro]**

(Spoken)
*Alright class, settle down.*
*Let's talk about the stack and the heap.*
*The fundamentals run deep.*
*Time for a little beat...*

**[Chorus]**
`Git commit -m "I'm a genius"`
`Git push` 'cause I'm ready to ship this.
Forget my late-night code tears.
This project is finally clear.
Now let's all get to merging our peers!

```
### [Verse: Eli Fisher on branch: verse/eli-fisher]

In lines of code, where no one has been,
I'm going to explore bugs none have seen,
Customers hurt my brain,
Saying things that will bring pain...
     
```

```
### Verse: Landen Shipp on branch: verse/Landen-Shipp

I don't know what im doing
my mind im always losing
security is my specialty
computer science i'm experiencing
my mind i'm losing
```
**[Outro]**
And that's the tale of how we made the grade.
Our code, our anthem, beautifully laid.
One repo, many branches, now a single file.
This class anthem will last a while.
