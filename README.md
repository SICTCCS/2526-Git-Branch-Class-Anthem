# 2526-Git-Branch-Class-Anthem
Practicing Branches and making a song with the 2526 Senior Class

(Spoken)
*Alright class, settle down.*
*Let's talk about the stack and the heap.*
*The fundamentals run deep.*
*Time for a little beat...*

**[Chorus]**
`Git commit -m "I'm a genius"`
`Git push` 'cause I'm ready to ship this.
Forget my late-night code tears.
This project is finally clear.
Now let's all get to merging our peers!

**[Devins Verse]**
Im gitin these branches
doing so many dances
commitin to these repos
you know ive got a big ego

**[Outro]**
And that's the tale of how we made the grade.
Our code, our anthem, beautifully laid.
One repo, many branches, now a single file.
This class anthem will last a while.
