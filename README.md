# 2526-Git-Branch-Class-Anthem

Practicing Branches and making a song with the 2526 Senior Class



Branch it out, don’t break the tree,

We’re all synced up in Git history.

No 8K streams, don't kill the speed,

The EVSC net’s got limited need.



Merge or rebase? The classic debate,

My head's in fast-forward, repo won’t update.

"Network timeout," now I’m feeling the pain,

Bro, just pause the stream — it’s not even game day!
