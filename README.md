`Git commit -m "I'm a genius"`
`Git push` 'cause I'm ready to ship this.
Forget my late-night code tears.
This project is finally clear.
Now let's all get to merging our peers!

If I'm being honest, coding makes my brain hurt
Sometimes I get mad, then random things I blurt
When assignments grow, say goodbye to your time
Cuz now the only thing your doing is an endless climb
Sometimes this class can feel hopeless,
cuz all of these words feel worthless.

### [Verse: Justin Long on branch: verse/Justin-Long]
This is the 48th bug today,\
hope this fix works i gotta pray,\
been up all night crying,\
code is hard man but im trying.
my head is pounding,\
I feel like i'm drowning.

`Git commit -m "I'm a genius"`
`Git push` 'cause I'm ready to ship this.
Forget my late-night code tears.

Now let's all get to merging our peers!

Why isn't my code working?\
Ok, it works now.\
Why is it working?\
Nevermind, it's broken somewhere else now.\
Chased one bug away, two more just came prowling. \
This project’s a circus, and I’m the one clowning.

`Git commit -m "I'm a genius"`

Honestly, this class is fun,
But I often wish it were done.
I kinda thought we'd do more,
than make such websites galore.
We code and click till our brains are sore,
Dreaming of sleep and nothing more.

In bytes and code I spin my art,
With facts and jokes to play my part,
Ask away and you will see,
A world of words through ChatGPT.
