**[Chorus]**
`Git commit -m "I'm a genius"`
`Git push` 'cause I'm ready to ship this.
Forget my late-night code tears.
This project is finally clear.
Now let's all get to merging our peers!


 yo bro check it I got some code but somthing is wrong.
 that looks like a big bug someone call the debug control.
 this copilot code is so bad it makes me hate it
 double check yo code otherwise a bug will survive, gotta crush it.
 crush it, crush it, like there is no tommorow otherwise its a fail.


** [Chorus] **
`Git commit -m "I'm a genius"`
`Git push` 'cause I'm ready to ship this.
Forget my late-night code tears.
This project is finally clear.
Now let's all get to merging our peers!


Up 15 hours debugging this code
all because i dont wanna use ai, no
4 monsters in and im about to weep
please let this be done so i can sleep
if this works i will be so relieved
that i might just shout hallelujah
