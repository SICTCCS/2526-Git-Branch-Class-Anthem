## [Verse: scott-kaplewski on branch: verse/scott-kaplewski]
If I'm being honest, coding makes my brain hurt
Sometimes I get mad, then random things I blurt
When assignments grow, say goodbye to your time
Cuz now the only thing your doing is an endless climb
Sometimes this class can feel hopeless,
cuz all of these words feel worthless.
