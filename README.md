# 2526-Git-Branch-Class-Anthem

**[Intro]**

(Spoken)
*Alright class, settle down.*
*Let's talk about the stack and the heap.*
*The fundamentals run deep.*
*Time for a little beat...*

**[Chorus]**
`Git commit -m "I'm a genius"`
`Git push` 'cause I'm ready to ship this.
Forget my late-night code tears.
This project is finally clear.
Now let's all get to merging our peers!

```
### [Verse: Eli Fisher on branch: verse/eli-fisher]

In lines of code, where no one has been,
I'm going to explore bugs none have seen,
Customers hurt my brain,
Saying things that will bring pain...
this work got me cryin'
i feel like im dyin'
```

```
### Verse: Landen Shipp on branch: verse/Landen-Shipp

I don't know what im doing
my mind im always losing
security is my specialty
computer science i'm experiencing
my mind i'm losing
```

```
### Drew's table

Branch it out, don’t break the tree,

We’re all synced up in Git history.

No 8K streams, don't kill the speed,

The EVSC net’s got limited need.


Merge or rebase? The classic debate,

My head's in fast-forward, repo won’t update.

"Network timeout," now I’m feeling the pain,

Bro, just pause the stream — it’s not even game day!


Im gitin these branches,

doing so many dances,

commitin to these repos,

you know ive got a big ego.



Got me feelin' kinda droopy,

all this code makin me loopy,

"Where is this", "What is that?",

I have this stuff takin' me back!

Back and forth is all we do,

Always worrying about when things are due.

[Verse: Kenneth-Payne on branch: verse/Kenneth-Payne]

In Lines of code, a world is spun.
with branching projects, the fun's begun.
Annoying bugs in the code.
we got power in edit mode. 
But the night is still young.
And so many projects yet to begun.  

[Verse: Ezra Schaefer on branch: ezra-schaefer]
My code ran so clean, a developer's dream,
No errors in sight, or so it would seem.
But a single user, with one strange click,
Brought the whole system down, oh ain't that a trick.
Try to fix but got a nervous tick.

```

**[Outro]**
And that's the tale of how we made the grade.
Our code, our anthem, beautifully laid.
One repo, many branches, now a single file.
This class anthem will last a while.
