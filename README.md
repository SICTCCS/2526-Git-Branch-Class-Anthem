**[Chorus]**
# yo bro check it I got some code but somthing is wrong.
# that looks like a big bug someone call the debug control.
# this copilot code is so bad it makes me hate it
# double check yo code otherwise a bug will survive, gotta crush it.
# crush it, crush it, like there is no tommorow otherwise its a fail.
