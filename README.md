# 2526-Git-Branch-Class-Anthem



















`Git commit -m "I'm a genius"`
`Git push` 'cause I'm ready to ship this.
Forget my late-night code tears.
This project is finally clear.
Now let's all get to merging our peers!

[Versed by Ethan Gilles] Programmers survive on coffee, black and bold,
Debugging bugs till 4 a.m., stories retold.
In loops and logic, they chase the spark,
Code dreams flicker in the silent dark.
Python keeps us up at night with a slient mark
no rest for the wicked be hindered in stark.
