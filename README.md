**[Chorus]**
 yo bro check it I got some code but somthing is wrong.
 that looks like a big bug someone call the debug control.
 this copilot code is so bad it makes me hate it
 double check yo code otherwise a bug will survive, gotta crush it.
 crush it, crush it, like there is no tommorow otherwise its a fail.
 Up 15 hours debugging this code 
 all because I dont wanna use ai, no 
 4 monsters in and im about to weep 
 please let this be done so I can sleep 
 if this works I will be so relieved 
 that I might just shout hallelujah
