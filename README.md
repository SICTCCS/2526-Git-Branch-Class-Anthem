Practicing Branches and making a song with the 2526 Senior Class
**[Chorus]**
`Git commit -m "I'm a genius"`
`Git push` 'cause I'm ready to ship this.
Forget my late-night code tears.
This project is finally clear.
Now let's all get to merging our peers!

### [Verse: Justin Long on branch: verse/Justin-Long]
This is the 48th bug today,\
hope this fix works i gotta pray,\
been up all night crying,\
code is hard man but im trying.
my head is pounding,\
I feel like i'm drowning.

**[Chorus]**
`Git commit -m "I'm a genius"`
`Git push` 'cause I'm ready to ship this.
Forget my late-night code tears.
This project is finally clear.
Now let's all get to merging our peers!

Why isn't my code working?\
Ok, it works now.\
Why is it working?\
Nevermind, it's broken somewhere else now.\
Chased one bug away, two more just came prowling. \
This project’s a circus, and I’m the one clowning.
