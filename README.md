# 2526-Git-Branch-Class-Anthem
Practicing Branches and making a song with the 2526 Senior Class

`Git commit -m "I'm a genius"`
`Git push` 'cause I'm ready to ship this.
Forget my late-night code tears.
This project is finally clear.
Now let's all get to merging our peers!

Honestly, this class is fun,
But I often wish it were done.
I kinda thought we'd do more,
than make such websites galore.
We code and click till our brains are sore,
Dreaming of sleep and nothing more.
