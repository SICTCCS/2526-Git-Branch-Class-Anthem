If I'm being honest, coding makes my brain hurt
Sometimes I get mad, then random things I blurt
When assignments grow, say goodbye to your time
Cuz now the only thing your doing is an endless climb
Sometimes this class can feel hopeless,
cuz all of these words feel worthless.

Programmers survive on coffee, black and bold,
Debugging bugs till 4 a.m., stories retold.
In loops and logic, they chase the spark,
Code dreams flicker in the silent dark.
Python keeps us up at night with a slient mark
no rest for the wicked be hindered in stark.

 yo bro check it I got some code but somthing is wrong.
 that looks like a big bug someone call the debug control.
 this copilot code is so bad it makes me hate it
 double check yo code otherwise a bug will survive, gotta crush it.
 crush it, crush it, like there is no tommorow otherwise its a fail.

Up 15 hours debugging this code

4 monsters in and im about to weep

that i might just shout hallelujah

I feel like i'm drowning.

Why isn't my code working?\
Ok, it works now.\
Why is it working?\
Nevermind, it's broken somewhere else now.\
Chased one bug away, two more just came prowling. \
This project’s a circus, and I’m the one clowning.

Honestly, this class is fun,
But I often wish it were done.
I kinda thought we'd do more,
than make such websites galore.
We code and click till our brains are sore,
Dreaming of sleep and nothing more.

In bytes and code I spin my art,
With facts and jokes to play my part,
Ask away and you will see,
A world of words through ChatGPT.

[Verse: Kenneth-Payne on branch: verse/Kenneth-Payne]
In Lines of code, a world is spun.
with branching projects, the fun's begun.
Annoying bugs in the code.
we got power in edit mode. 
But the night is still young.
And so many projects yet to be done.  

[Verse: Ezra Schaefer on branch: ezra-schaefer]
My code ran so clean, a developer's dream,
No errors in sight, or so it would seem.
But a single user, with one strange click,
Brought the whole system down, oh ain't that a trick.
Try to fix but got a nervous tick.

### [Verse: Eli Fisher on branch: verse/eli-fisher]

In lines of code, where no one has been,
I'm going to explore bugs none have seen,
Customers hurt my brain,
Saying things that will bring pain...
this work got me cryin'
i feel like im dyin'

### Verse: Landen Shipp on branch: verse/Landen-Shipp

I don't know what im doing
my mind im always losing
security is my specialty
computer science i'm experiencing
my mind i'm losing

### Drew's table

Branch it out, don’t break the tree,
We’re all synced up in Git history.
No 8K streams, don't kill the speed,
The EVSC net’s got limited need.

Merge or rebase? The classic debate,
My head's in fast-forward, repo won’t update.
"Network timeout," now I’m feeling the pain,
Bro, just pause the stream — it’s not even game day!

Im gitin these branches,
doing so many dances,
commitin to these repos,
you know ive got a big ego.

Got me feelin' kinda droopy,
all this code makin me loopy,
"Where is this", "What is that?",
I have this stuff takin' me back!
Back and forth is all we do,
Always worrying about when things are due.
