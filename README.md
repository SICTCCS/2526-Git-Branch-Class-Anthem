Practicing Branches and making a song with the 2526 Senior Class
**[Chorus]**
`Git commit -m "I'm a genius"`
`Git push` 'cause I'm ready to ship this.
Forget my late-night code tears.
This project is finally clear.
Now let's all get to merging our peers!

### [Verse: Justin Long on branch: verse/Justin-Long]
This is the 48th bug today,\
hope this fix works i gotta pray,\
been up all night crying,\
code is hard man but im trying.
my head is pounding,\
I feel like i'm drowning.
