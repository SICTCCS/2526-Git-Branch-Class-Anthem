If I'm being honest, coding makes my brain hurt
Sometimes I get mad, then random things I blurt
When assignments grow, say goodbye to your time
Cuz now the only thing your doing is an endless climb
Sometimes this class can feel hopeless,
cuz all of these words feel worthless.

Programmers survive on coffee, black and bold,
Debugging bugs till 4 a.m., stories retold.
In loops and logic, they chase the spark,
Code dreams flicker in the silent dark.
Python keeps us up at night with a slient mark
no rest for the wicked be hindered in stark.

 yo bro check it I got some code but somthing is wrong.
 that looks like a big bug someone call the debug control.
 this copilot code is so bad it makes me hate it
 double check yo code otherwise a bug will survive, gotta crush it.
 crush it, crush it, like there is no tommorow otherwise its a fail.

Why isn't my code working?\
Ok, it works now.\
Why is it working?\
Nevermind, it's broken somewhere else now.\
Chased one bug away, two more just came prowling. \
This project’s a circus, and I’m the one clowning.

Honestly, this class is fun,
But I often wish it were done.
I kinda thought we'd do more,
than make such websites galore.
We code and click till our brains are sore,
Dreaming of sleep and nothing more.

In bytes and code I spin my art,
With facts and jokes to play my part,
Ask away and you will see,
A world of words through ChatGPT.
