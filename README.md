# 2526-Git-Branch-Class-Anthem
Practicing Branches and making a song with the 2526 Senior Class

**[Intro]**

(Spoken)<br>
*Alright class, settle down.*<br>
*Let's talk about the stack and the heap.*<br>
*The fundamentals run deep.*<br>
*Time for a little beat...*<br>

**[Chorus]**<br>
`Git commit -m "I'm a genius"`<br>
`Git push` 'cause I'm ready to ship this.<br>
Forget my late-night code tears.<br>
This project is finally clear.<br>
Now let's all get to merging our peers!

**[Verse: Kenneth-Payne on branch: verse/Kenneth-Payne]**<br>
In Lines of code, a world is spun.<br>
with branching projects, the fun's begun.<br>
Annoying bugs in the code.<br>
we got power in edit mode.

**[Outro]**<br>
And that's the tale of how we made the grade.<br>
Our code, our anthem, beautifully laid.<br>
One repo, many branches, now a single file.<br>
This class anthem will last a while.<br>
