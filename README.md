# 2526-Git-Branch-Class-Anthem

**[Chorus]**
`Git commit -m "I'm a genius"`
`Git push` 'cause I'm ready to ship this.
Forget my late-night code tears.
This project is finally clear.
Now let's all get to merging our peers!

yo bro checkit I got some code but somthing is wrong.
that looks like a big bug someone call the debug control.
double check yo code otherwise a bug will survive, gota crush it.
crush it, crush it, like there is no tommorow otherwise its a fail.
