**[Chorus]**
`Git commit -m "I'm a genius"`
`Git push` 'cause I'm ready to ship this.
Forget my late-night code tears.
This project is finally clear.
Now let's all get to merging our peers!

### [Verse: Johana Isabela Cook on branch: verse/Johana-Isabela-Cook]

We write the code that shapes the world, one logic gate at a time
Branching out through the repos, where our algorithms climb
Debugging through the chaos, with our keyboards as our swords
In the syntax of the future, we are crafting digital chords
