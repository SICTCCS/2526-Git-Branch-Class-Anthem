# 2526-Git-Branch-Class-Anthem
Practicing Branches and making a song with the 2526 Senior Class
# ðŸŽ¸ The Git Branch Class Anthem ðŸ’»

Welcome, collaborators! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write a class anthem using the power of Git branches. This song will document our collective journey through computer science.

You will write your own unique verse. Our final song will be a masterpiece of collaborative code, merged together for all eternity.

### **The Song So Far...**

(Do not edit this section directly. The final song will be compiled here.)

**[Intro]**

(Spoken)
*Alright class, settle down.*
*Let's talk about the stack and the heap.*
*The fundamentals run deep.*
*Time for a little beat...*

**[Chorus]**
`Git commit -m "I'm a genius"`
`Git push` 'cause I'm ready to ship this.
Forget my late-night code tears.
This project is finally clear.
Now let's all get to merging our peers!

### [Verse: Ezra Schaefer on branch: ezra-schaefer]

My code ran so clean, a developer's dream,
No errors in sight, or so it would seem.
But a single user, with one strange click,
Brought the whole system down, oh ain't that a trick.

**[Outro]**
And that's the tale of how we made the grade.
Our code, our anthem, beautifully laid.
One repo, many branches, now a single file.
This class anthem will last a while.

### **Assignment Instructions**

Follow these steps carefully. Each step should be completed before moving to the next.

1. **Clone the Repo:**

2. **Create Your Branch:** Create a new branch for your verse. Make sure the branch name follows this exact format: `verse/your-full-name` (e.g., `verse/jane-doe`).

3. **Write Your Verse:**

   * Open this `README.md` file in a text editor.

   * Find the `[Chorus]` section. After the chorus, add a new section for your verse.

   * Your verse should be exactly **four lines** long and should flow. It should be funny and computer science themed (e.g., debugging, a difficult assignment, coding all night).

   * Put your name and branch name above your verse like this:

     ```
     ### [Verse: <your-name> on branch: <your-branch>]
     Your rhyming verse goes here!
     
     
     ```

4. **Push Your Verse:**

   * Stage your changes

   * Commit your changes

   * Push your branch to GitHub. The first time you push a new branch, you'll need to set the upstream.

5. **Edit Your Partner's Verse:**

   * Find your desk partner's repository link.

   * Check out their branch

   * Read their verse and add **one or two** new rhyming line to the end of it. The line should be a response or a humorous addition.

   * Push your change back to their branch.

6. **The Final Song:**

   * The class, as a team, is now responsible for getting all the verses merged into the `main` branch.

   * Discuss and decide as a class on the best way to do this. Who will merge? What order should the verses be in? How will you resolve any conflicts?

   * Once all the merges are complete, run `git pull` on your local `main` branch to get the complete, merged song. Congratulations, you're a published artist!
